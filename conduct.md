* U = Unacceptable

## Categories of Conduct

## Overall Conduct

This section defines how each class member should and should not act while
participating in CMPSC 201 course during Fall 2020. Everyone is
required to adhere to not only this section, but also the following eight
sections of this Code of Conduct. Most important in this section is that
members respect their peers, regardless of race or gender, as learners. This
is a course in which individuals have different skillsets and different
levels of mastery in those skills, and disrespecting or shunning a class member
for lack of knowledge violates this Code of Conduct. Viewing and using other
people's work is a core part of learning  how to learn and code effectively, yet when
used irresponsibly (such as directly copying another peer's work without their
permission or without crediting them) such code will negatively impact
learning success. Therefore, members of this course should adhere to
Allegheny's honor code for all submitted work.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall
    * Show respect for all peers as learners and team members
    * Allow peers to voice their opinions and questions
    * Read, understand, and follow all parts of this code of Conduct
    * Follow the honor code on all submitted work
    * Come prepared to class
    * Pay attention to the lecturer or presenter when being presented
    * Show respect to the instructor through paying attention during class and participating during class

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not
    * Disrespect peers because of their race or gender
    * Prevent peers from voicing their opinions and questions
    * Violate any part of this Code of Conduct
    * Violate the Allegheny honor code in regards to all submitted work
    * Navigate to other websites or programs not related to class materials
    * Directly copy another peer's work without crediting them

### Attendance

Students are expected to attend class sessions and laboratory sessions in person
and remotely depending on what attendance group they were assigned at the start
of the semester. In addition to that and due to the nature of the course students
should also be expected to communicate and work collaboratively outside of class
with team members on a laboratory or project assignment. There are exceptions to
this rule that take into account emergencies and illnesses.  

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall
    * Arrive to class in a timely manner
    * Regularly attend class sessions
    * Attend outside sessions with group members, if needed, for group projects

    * Miss three consecutive days without a valid excuse
    * Not arrive to a class more than fifteen minutes without a valid excuse
    * Leave class early without an excuse

### Deadlines

Students are expected to follow the due dates of assignments online through the
course website and on Slack. Exceptions should be made for emergencies and illnesses.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall
    * Turn in work before a due date
    * Watch the course website and Slack for changes to due dates
    * :heavy_exclamation_mark: TODO: add items in the A category for deadlines

  * Members shall not
    * Turn in their work after a due date
    * Turn in their work through the incorrect medium.
    * :heavy_exclamation_mark: TODO: add items in the U category for deadlines

### Communication

Since the nature of this course has changed communication is more vital than ever
for students. Students are expected to stay in regular communication and
watch and participate in Slack, Zoom, and email communications.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall
    * Ask questions if they are unsure of what they need to do or how to do it
    * Listen to and consider ideas presented by others
    * Give proper notice about any absences to lab meetings or changes they will make
    to the project itself

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not
    * Leave messages unanswered for unacceptable lengths of time, thus disrupting
    effective collaboration and productivity. This extends to Email, Slack, Github,
    and any other mediums of communication
    * Disrespect the work and opinions of others or otherwise provide deconstructive
    criticism. Github threads, Slack channels, and any other platforms for discussing
    opinions and development are limited to professional discourse
    * Refuse to complete work on sections of the project that they had said they
    would work on prior

## Team Work

Some of the class activities and lab projects will require team collaboration.
This section of the Code of Conduct will provide guidance on effective and
inclusive team work.

### Participation

Every class member needs to be actively and cooperatively involved with the
class activities and lab projects at hand. This will ensure the
flow of questions, ideas, and thoughts in a respectful manner. Our learning
environment at its root includes participation, candidness
and insightful collaboration. Participating in team-based project discussion means
engaging in conversation, not just answering questions. The goal here is to show up and
truly be all there.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall
    * Respond quickly in Slack to clarify confusing issues or assist other colleagues
    * Value and consider everyone’s opinion
    * Be willing to meetup and work outside of class
    * Be respectful of each team member's time commitments when working outside of class
    * Approach issues and team members with professionalism
    * Demonstrate continuous engagement with tasks
    * Be open minded
    * Raise a disagreeing opinion in a respectful manner
    * Ensure that they are distributing the workload for laboratory and class assignments evenly amongst _all_ team members
    * Be understanding and compassionate regarding the various learning/living situations a student may face this semester
    * Ask questions when necessary using an * in the Zoom chat or raising your hand in person.

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not
    * Demonstrate disrespect for team members
    * Have an inappropriate professional boundary with team members
    * Show poor participation and attitude to their lab delegated tasks
    * Demonstrate patterns of poor communication or little effort for
    collaboration in lab and Slack
    * Disrupt working teams' effectiveness by lack of collaboration
    * Attempt to dominate a lab discussions
    * Avoid contributing to lab discussions
    * Demonstrate disruptive behavior that inhibits others from participating in discussions
    * Discriminate against team members based on race, class year, gender, or level of knowledge

### Decisions

The majority of individuals in a team should agree on a given decision before the
project is implemented. It should be made with supporting evidence that shows
that the decision is productive. When unsure about making a decision
it is a good idea to defer to a technical leader or the professor. One should
reach out to other teams whom the choice will influence. Teams will determine
how long a decision will take to implement.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall
    * Take into account everyone's input in the decision making process
    * Stay flexible and be willing to change if it would be productive
    * Report errors or bugs to the appropriate team members
    * Record what choice was made and when it was implemented
    * Defer to the Professor or student technical leaders when unsure
    * Distribute tasks to all team members in a timely manner
    * A new decision should be made when a previous decision cannot be implemented
    * When a choice is disputed, use Github issue tracker and let team members
      share their opinion
    * :heavy_exclamation_mark: TODO: add any additional items in the A category for the decision making as a team

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not
    * Let an individual team member or a project manager make major decisions
    * Make decisions without finding evidence showing that it would likely be beneficial
    * Directly contradict the decision
    * Refuse to work on the decided option
    * Make decisions that would affect another team without first notifying them
    * Refuse to use the issue tracker to discuss a disagreement
    * :heavy_exclamation_mark: TODO: add any additional items in the U category for the decision making as a team

### Postmortems

Postmortems are great ways of looking at and analyzing the performance of
the project after its launch. Through postmortems we can look at what was
successful and what failed and needs improvement. These discussions also
provide great insight in how to improve in future projects.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall
    * Work as a team to create a postmortem plan to review and fix sections of the project
    * Come up with different approaches to solve issues with the project
    * Participate in the discussions in a respectful and courteous manner
    while adhering to the communications section of the code of conduct
    * Provide constructive feedback and propose solutions for issues faced
    * Receive feedback and discuss how it could be used to improve future projects and assignments
    * Communicate and think practically/realistically on ways to improve the program based on efficiency and the skills we have learned throughout the course and at Allegheny
    * Account for situational factors that may come up with remote work when giving feedback and discussing solutions
    * Keep postmortems blameless to increase the accountability in a group and to prevent team members from being blamed
    * All decisions coming from the results of a postmortem should be arrived through a democratic process based on a majority support from group members
    * :heavy_exclamation_mark: TODO: add any additional items in the A category for the decision making as a team

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not
    * Insult others while presenting criticism
    * Blame other members for any issues with the final product
    * Refuse to collaborate in fixing remaining issues while a project or lab has not been completed
    * Make fun of other people’s solutions
    * Take all credit for all of the team members work that the individual did not do and blame others for everything wrong
    * Target a specific team member when discussing a post mortem or the remaining bugs in a laboratory or project assignment
    * Decide what to do after a postmortem that the majority of the project or laboratory group doesn't agree with
    * Claim that one subjective way of achieving a solution is the only correct way of working towards it
    * :heavy_exclamation_mark: TODO: add any additional items in the U category for the decision making as a team

### Conflicts

It is inevitable that conflicts will arise when working as a large group. It is essential, however, to resolve these conflicts in a professional manner while keeping in mind the concerns of everyone involved.

* Acceptable Conduct (A):
  * Members shall
    * Resolve conflicts before they become severe by engaging in respectful conversations
    * If conflicts become severe between class members, they should be brought
    to the attention of the project managers who will work to resolve any issues
    * Project managers, technical leaders and the course instructor are
    responsible for resolving any issues by proposing solutions to reach a
    compromise between class members involved
    * Project managers may reassign different tasks to group members to solve a conflict
    * The course instructor has a final say in how severe conflicts should be resolved
    * Be respectful and open-minded with everybody in the team when encountering a conflict
    * Conflict involving violence will be reported to the instructors and Dean of students
    * Be considerate and listen to everyone in the group carefully before determining a suitable solution for the issue
    * Politely disagree with other students ideas but not in a way that harms the group or individual students
    * Not physically injure others or try or attack members in order to resolve conflicts
    * :heavy_exclamation_mark: TODO: add any additional items in the A category for the decision making as a team

* Unacceptable Conduct (U):
  * Members shall not
    * Encourage or engage in conflicts that undermine the code of conduct
    * Escalate existing conflicts that jeopardize the group project
    * Disregard or refuse to resolve an existing conflict that has been brought to their attention
    * Harassing others with discriminatory jokes and languages
    * Hold grudges against others for previous conflicts
    * Hide conflicts within a group to prevent interventions to mitigate problems
    * :heavy_exclamation_mark: TODO: add any additional items in the U category for the decision making as a team

## Infractions

An infraction occurs when class member(s) violate the agreed
rules present in the code of conduct. Any action
that is considered "Unacceptable" will cause an
infraction. Class member(s) should avoid infractions since the accumulation of
them would cause penalties and hinder the progress of the project.

The severity of the infraction is determined by the number of
previous infractions. Higher number of past infractions would cause a higher
level infraction and thus a more severe penalty.

This guideline for infractions is separate from the Allegheny College Honor code
guidelines. While the Honor Code involves all students in Allegheny College and
is enforced by the college's Honor Committee, this code of conduct only
includes members of the Data Abstraction class for the Fall semester
of 2020.

* *Infractions shall be imposed at three different levels of severity:*

* Level I: Any violation of a code of conduct rule is by default a Level I infraction. Technical leaders and instructor will be keeping track of infractions.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: TODO: Add an action to be taken for the level I infraction

* Level II: Upon the accumulation of three level I infractions, project managers and the instructor will issue a formal level II infraction.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: TODO: Add an action to be taken for the level II infraction

* Level III A Level III infraction will be given to an individual who has accumulated five Level I infractions.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: TODO: Add an action to be taken for the level III infraction

Class member(s) are encouraged to report any infractions in order to ensure
a safe, inclusive and collegial environment.

Class member(s) may appeal any infraction to the instructor of the class.
Any decision made by the instructor for the given infraction(s) will be final.
